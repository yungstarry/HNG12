## 1. Introduction
The Google Play Store is a competitive marketplace where millions of apps compete for user attention. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of app performance, user engagement, and monetization trends using advanced analytics and predictive modeling. The insights will help Google Play Store executives optimize pricing strategies, improve user retention, and identify growth opportunities.  
This study also integrates external data from the Apple App Store to provide competitive benchmarks, enabling a cross-platform comparison.  
This report documents the advanced business insights dashboard developed for Google Play Store, leveraging the Google Play Store dataset and an external Apple App Store dataset to drive app performance, user engagement, and revenue growth. It outlines our data preparation, 10 key performance indicators (KPIs), critical insights, and strategic recommendations to guide executive decisions. Predictive analytics, including a 12-month install forecast, highlight growth opportunities, benchmarked against Apple’s market trends. This dashboard, hosted on Power BI, provides interactive, actionable insights for senior leadership to enhance market dominance, user retention, and revenue generation by February 27, 2025.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
The dataset contained missing values, inconsistencies, and unnecessary columns that required cleaning before analysis. Below are the steps taken to ensure data quality and reliability: For this project, Power BI and Power Query were used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to generate actionable insights.

### 2.1 Handling Duplicates
- Removed duplicate records based on the `App ID` column to ensure each app is uniquely represented.

### 2.2 Handling Missing Values
- **Rating Count**: Null values were replaced with 0 to maintain data integrity.  
- **Rating**: Null values were replaced with the median rating (2.9) to avoid skewing data.  
- **Installs & Minimum Installs**: Null values were replaced with 0 instead of the median because:  
  - *Business Logic*: If there’s no data, it’s logical to assume 0 installs (the app has not been installed yet).  
  - *Analytical Accuracy*: Using a median value would artificially inflate installation numbers.  
- **Currency**: Blank values (135 rows) were replaced with "Unknown" since the impact on analysis is minimal.  

### 2.3 Size Column
- Created a new column by removing `M` (millions) and `K` (thousands) and converting them into numeric values:  
  - `10M` → 10,000,000  
  - `5K` → 5,000  
- Replaced "Varies with device" with the median value (10,000,000 bytes).

### 2.4 Standardizing the Minimum Android Version
- Extracted the minimum required Android version from text strings and converted it to a decimal number:  
  - Example: "7.1 and up" → 7.1  
  - Example: "4.0.3 - 7.1.1" → 4.0.3  
- Replaced "Varies with device" with 1.0 (the lowest estimated Android version).

### 2.5 Price Normalization
- `Price_USD` reflects the normalized price value in USD based on the original currency and exchange rates.  
- This ensures a consistent pricing structure across different regions, allowing for strategic insights on app pricing and revenue potential.

### 2.6 Handling Missing Release Dates
- 3% of apps had missing release dates. If an app’s release date was missing but had a last updated date, we used that as a replacement.

## 3. Dropped Columns and Justification
To improve data efficiency and focus on business-critical insights, the following columns were dropped:

| Column Name       | Reason for Removal                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developer Id      | Unique identifier, not useful for analysis. Developer performance can be analyzed using the Developer name. |
| Developer Email   | Contact information is not relevant for app performance or user engagement.         |
| Developer Website | Like email, this is operational data and not useful for KPI analysis.               |
| Developer Address | Physical location does not impact app installs, revenue, or ratings.                |
| Privacy Policy    | A legal/operational detail, not relevant for revenue or engagement analysis.        |
| Scraped Time      | Metadata for dataset freshness, not useful for business insights.                   |

### 4.1 Total Installs (Engagement & Market Reach)
- The dataset showed 403.81 billion installs across all apps.  
- This metric reflects overall market reach and app adoption rates.

### 4.2 User Engagement Score (Rating Count per Install) by Category
- **Formula**: `AVG(Rating Count / Installs) GROUP BY Category`  
- This metric highlights how engaged users are based on their likelihood to leave ratings.

- Apple’s App Store tends to have higher-priced paid apps compared to Google Play.  
- This suggests Apple users may be more willing to pay for apps, influencing potential pricing strategies.

### 4.5 Revenue Potential Analysis
- Estimated $90,163 billion in revenue potential based on price and install data.  
- **Key insight**: Business and productivity apps generate the most revenue per install.

## 5. Key Business Insights
Our analysis of the Google Play Store dataset, combined with Apple App Store benchmarks, reveals critical insights to drive strategic decisions, ensuring market leadership and revenue growth:  
- **Strong Growth Potential in Business Apps**: Business apps on Google Play demonstrate robust growth, with a 12-month forecast predicting 7.69bn installs, benchmarked against Apple’s 20% review growth in the same genre. This indicates a prime opportunity for enterprise-focused marketing and development investments, positioning Google Play as a leader in business solutions.  
- **Moderate User Satisfaction with Improvement Needs**: The average user rating across apps is 4.2/5.0, reflecting moderate satisfaction, but categories like Games require quality enhancements, as 20% of apps fall below 4.0, potentially limiting installs and engagement. Addressing these gaps could drive a 5% increase in ratings, boosting user retention.  
- **Significant Revenue Opportunities**: Paid apps offer a $90.163bn revenue potential, particularly in high-install categories like Games (18.1bn installs), highlighting a substantial monetization opportunity if expanded. This insight underscores the need to shift focus toward paid and in-app purchase models to maximize financial growth.  
- **Dominance of Free Apps with Monetization Gaps**: Free apps constitute 99.85% of the market, indicating a reliance on ad-supported and in-app purchase revenue. Increasing paid app adoption (e.g., to 1%) and in-app purchases (e.g., 10% in Games) could unlock substantial revenue growth, diversifying income streams beyond free models.  
- **Market Leadership in Key Categories**: Games and Business dominate market share, with Games leading at 18.1bn installs, suggesting a focus area for development, marketing, and partnerships to maintain leadership. Business apps, with forecasted growth to 7.69bn installs, also present untapped potential for enterprise expansion.  
- **Predictive Insights from Apple Benchmark**: Apple’s 20% review growth in Business apps over 6 months informs our 12-month Google Play forecast, adjusted by 75% (0.75 factor) for market differences. This ensures accurate predictions, enabling proactive resource allocation and competitive positioning against Apple’s trends.
