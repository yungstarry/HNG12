## ðŸ“Œ **1. Introduction**

This report presents a comprehensive **network analysis** of the GitHub developer community using the **GitHub MUSAE dataset** from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the social structure of GitHub developers, focusing on their influence, collaboration patterns, and connectivity. The findings are intended to support **Backend.IM** in enhancing its marketing strategies, user segmentation, and community engagement for API testing features.

The objectives of this study are to:
- Identify **key influencers** in the GitHub developer community.
- Understand **collaboration patterns** between Web and ML developers.
- Analyze **connectivity**, **clustering**, and **bridging nodes** in the network.
- Predict developer types (Web vs. ML) based on **network properties**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **2. Dataset Used**

The dataset used is the **GitHub MUSAE dataset**, a social network dataset representing mutual follower relationships between GitHub users. Key details include:
- **Nodes**: 37,700 GitHub users (developers).
- **Edges**: 289,003 mutual follower relationships.
- **Node Attributes**: Each user is labeled as either a `Web` developer (0) or an `ML` developer (1) based on the `ml_target` column in `musae_git_target.csv`.
- **Source Files**:
  - `musae_git_edges.csv`: Edge list with columns `id_1` and `id_2` representing follower relationships.
  - `musae_git_target.csv`: Node labels with columns `id` and `ml_target`.

The dataset was loaded into a `networkx` graph `G`, where nodes represent developers, edges represent mutual follower relationships, and each node has a `developer_type` attribute (`Web` or `ML`).
